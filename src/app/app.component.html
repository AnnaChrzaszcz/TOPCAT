          <h3>🪔 Teams Gigathlon: 🎙 commentary contest 🛶 gondola secret cruise 🍻 3-way Flanki 👯‍♀️ Dance Battle</h3>
          <p>30.7 17:29</p>
          <br>
          <p><br>Hello again!</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
            First of all, please be reminded that you can still send us the link to your Dance Battle song (to our e-mail or to Grycha directly). Also please check your payment status - tournament starts tommorrow, there is no time to wait.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>🚨 Team Gigathlon theme - the Escape from the Comfort Zone 🚨</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
            If you play 34 of 80/90 minutes games during the weekend, there is not much time left for side activities. However, we still want to organise Team Gigathlon for you, it's going to be shorter then initially planned. The theme of this year's gigathlon is getting out of your comfort zone, so be prepared to be embarassed like all the time. Have fun and be yourself - all the activities are non-obligatory, but it would be great if all the teams participated.
            </p>
            <br>
          <h3>1. 🎙 Commentary contest</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            So, we have a proffesional stream crew with 2 commentary stations. Replays? Yes off course! Slow motion? Why not! We just lack your voice!
<br>
            Join the commentary booth with a friend and help us shoutcasting the TOP CAT games. The best commentary team will be rewarded and get points for their team.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>2. 🛶  Gondola secret cruise</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            On Saturday at 19:30 in Pułtusk Castle Marina 12 daredevils from every team will start the special quest. Capitains should name the player that will go on the cruise and sign them up in tournaments office before the end of Saturday games. Capitain Helio will join the brave and challenge them with 3 questions:
            <br><br>
            <br>a)  The most epic memory from your team?
            <br>b)  The biggest fail in your team history?
            <br>c)  Every participant rolls the 12-side dice. Depending on the outcome, he/she asks 1 random question (don't have to be ultimate question, may be border question) other team's representant. The asked daredevil, have to answer sincerely.
            <br><br>
            Every answer and creative question will be evaluated by Helio, to decide point benefit for every participant's team.
          <br>
          </p>
          <h3>3. 🍻 3-way Flanki competition</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Flanki is a game of skills and focus. We decided to go one step further and make it even more difficult and fun. Every game will have 3 competing team, 3 players each. Each player will get small beer to his TOP CAT mug. Players throw the ball and try to bring down the can placed in the middle of the playing field. When the can is down, they start drinking, until other team correct the can's position. The tricky part is that 2 other teams will have to quickly decide who will run to correct the position of the can. We expect it to make it easier for the throwing team, and cause more laugh in the audience. The best teams will get a lot of points in Gigathlon's ranking.
            <br><br>
          </p>
          <h3>4. 👯‍️ Dance Battle</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            So basically, there are two possible outcomes: either we discover great dance talent in you, or you are going to make fool of yourselves and everybody else will laugh and cheer you up. We are going to dance as well, even if we can't really and only Grycha knows our routine :P Don't be afraid to participate even if you don't have anything prepared - get out of your comfort zone and have fun.
            <br>
            Winning the Dance Battle can give you many valuable points or even the win in Teams Gigathlon             <br><br>

          <p><br>Dear captains and players,
            <br><br>
            the TOP CAT 2020 is coming up soon. We have taken many steps to ensure your safety: the teams will be located in different accommodation areas; breakfast will be divided into the teams and delivered in boxes; the attractions will take place in the open-air, in large open spaces; each one of you will receive a personal cup so you can enjoy your beer safely. Also, we have prepared a lot of hand disinfection stations and lots of other small safety measures.
            <br>You come to the tournament to rest, have fun and play top ultimate frisbee; therefore, during the tournament we will no longer talk about the risk of COVID-19, assuming that everyone is aware of it. In this email, we would like to mention it for the last time.
            <br>Regardless of the safety measures and our ideas, <u>in the end, it is up to you to be sensible and make responsible decisions</u>. It is up to you to decide whether you make sure to drink from your own water bottle, bump fists or elbows, whether you kiss beautiful boys and girls during the party or rather send them erotic vibrations with your eyes. In many such matters there are no guidelines, and assessing what is risky and what is not risky rests in your hands. Please make your decisions consciously, respect other players’ decisions and do not cause situations they don’t to be in. I believe that this will not prevent you from having a great time with nice atmosphere and fun.
            <br><br>cpt Kostello

            <br>Dear all!
            <br><br>Get ready for one of the biggest attractions of the evening! Apart from the fierce matches and the best style competition, each team will be challenged to participate in the DANCE BATTLE! What is this about? <strong>By the Wednesday 29/7 please send us two songs to which you will design a choreography</strong>. Each team will have to present their dance to the audience. During the tournament, we will draw you a rival against whom you will fight on stage. Also, on Saturday morning, each team will draw a theme that you and your rival will have to spontaneously implement into your choreography (the rival will have the same theme), for example: a belly dance, jungle dance, baptism, etc. You will have all day to think about your performance.
          <br>🏆The winning teams will move on to the next stage, and with every stage it will be more and more difficult! In the second round, the second song of your choice will be played, but the theme will be drawn right before the performance itself.
          <br>🍾In the finals, there will be 3 teams and you will all dance together to our song. The winner will get a special prize.
          <br><br>Good luck!
            <br><br><b>PS: Grycha in her Flinston costume will be also the person you can ask anything during the games and the parties 🎉</b>

            Ok, there is a B-day Party on Saturday, what other parties do we have? Welcome Party on Friday. You can register your team there and get your gifts, there will be a grill prepared by our partner Hotel "Dom Polonii" where you can buy some sizzling bites (saussage, kashanka, shashlik etc.) and beer.
            <br><br>💰 To buy drinks you will need to get cryptocats first. <strong>Cryptocats are official TOP CAT's currency. CCs are "ocean tokens" made from old fishing nets. 1CC = 10 zł.</strong> To buy something from grill on Friday you need zlotys though.

          <h3>Music is important 🎤</h3>
          <br><p>19.07  02:01</p>
          <br>
          <p>20 hours of games means 20 hours of music, and that's not even half of all the music! We want you to get involved in creating the playlist and share some songs with us. We will play it (at least once) during the tournament.

            <h3>Gondola Cruise 🛶</h3>
          <br><p>19.07  00:01</p>
            <br>
          <p>At first we wanted to organise a cruise for each team, but it turned out to be too much time-consuming. In the end we decided we will send 12 representants from every team to the cruise, which will also be one of the Teams Gigathlon's disciplines. They will get to know each other and will be challanged by a special team-building task. Please choose your daredevil (1 player from your team) to join the gondola cruise and sign up in tournament's office by the end of Saturday games.
